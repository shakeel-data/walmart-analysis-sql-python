# walmart-analysis-sql-python
Walmart, as the worldâ€™s largest retail corporation, plays a crucial role in shaping global retail trends and consumer behavior. With an extensive network of stores and a massive volume of daily transactions, Walmart sets the standard for operational efficiency, pricing strategy, and supply chain management in the retail sector. Analyzing Walmartâ€™s sales data provides valuable insights into real-world retail dynamics, helping uncover patterns in customer preferences, regional performance, and product demand. Such analysis is essential for making informed, data-driven decisions that can improve sales, streamline operations, and drive business growth in the competitive retail landscape.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand transaction patterns across branches and cities
- Identify low-performing areas, product categories, and payment methods
- Generate insights to improve sales strategy and customer targeting
- Showcase a practical application of SQL and Python in solving real-world business problems

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow
### 1. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

### 2. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.
    
### 3. Installing & Importing Dependencies 
Set up the environment by installing and importing key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

#mysql toolkit
import pymysql #this will work as adapter
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

#psql
import psycopg2
```
### 4. Loading & Understanding the Dataset
Imported the CSV file and reviewed basic structure, column names, and sample records to understand the data content.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('walmart-10k-sales-datasets/Walmart.csv', encoding_errors='ignore')
df.head()
```

### 5.  Statistical information
Measures such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and quartiles were computed to understand the central tendency and spread of each variable.

### 6. Datatype 
Knowing the data types early on is essential for selecting the right transformations, visualizations, and models later in the workflow.

```python
df.info()
```

### 7. Data Cleaning, Preparation and Export
Verified and handled missing values, formatted columns, and prepared data for analysis using encoding techniques.

```python
# Check for missing values
df.duplicated().sum()
```

```python
# Drop duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df.duplicated().sum()
```

```python
# Check null values
df.isnull().sum()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff60cc40-c1f6-496f-af88-18214eb20c3e)

#### Dropping null values
```python
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Verify
df.isnull().sum()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcbb445b-61e7-462d-bd3c-dfa20ffe22ab)

#### Coverting unit price into float after removing $(dollar) sign
```python
df['unit_price'] = df['unit_price'].str.replace('$', '').astype(float)
df.head()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fcf30c-7d51-41fc-83ee-153debdc9e74)


#### Add a new column 'total'

```python
df['total'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity']
df.head()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ab31b7-e943-4458-9422-3dc16a8b161b)

#### Exporting clean data

```python
df.to_csv('Walmart_clean_data.csv', index=False)
df.shape
```

### 8. Database Integration
Imported into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin

```python
#psql connection
# "mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost:3306/db_name"
engine_psql = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/walmart_db")

try:
    engine_psql
    print("Successfully connected to postgresql")
except:
    print("Unable to connect postgresql")

df.to_sql(name='walmart', con=engine_psql, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```
